    "# Harnessing diversity in crowds and machines for better NER performance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the experimental results of identifying and typing named entities in English Wikipedia sentences. Even though current named entity recognition tools achieve nearly human-like performance or particular data types or domains, they are still highly dependent on the gold standard used for training and testing. The mainstream approach of gathering ground truth or gold standard for training and evaluating named entity recognition tools is still by means of experts, who are typically expensive and hard to find. Furthermore, for each new input type, or each new domain, new gold standards need to be created. Overall, the experts follow over-generalized annotation guidelines, meant to increase the <b>inter-annotator agreement</b> between experts. Such guidelines are thus prone to denying the intrinsic language ambiguity, multitude of perspectives and interpretations. Thus, ground truth datasets might not always be 'gold' or 'true' in terms of capturing the real text meaning and interpretation diversity. In the last decade crowdsourcing has also proven to be a suitable method for gathering such ground truth, but data ambiguity is still not handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in our work we focus on capturing the <b>inter-annotator disagreement</b> to provide a new type of ground truth, i.e., crowd truth - by applying the CrowdTruth metrics and methodology, where language features are taken into consideration. All the crowdsourcing experiments were performed through the CrowdTruth platform, while the results were processed and analyzed using the CrowdTruth methodology and metrics. For more information, check the <b><a href=\"http://crowdtruth.org/\">CrowdTruth</a></b> website. For gathering the annotated data, we used the <b><a href=\"http://corwdflower.com/\">CrowdFlower</a></b> marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose a novel approach for extracting and typing named entities in texts, i.e.m a hybrid multi-machine-crowd approach where state-of-the-art NER tools are combined and their aggregated output is validated and improved through crowdsourcing. We report here results of:\n",
    "1. Five state-of-the-art named entity recognition tools (Single-NER)\n",
    "2. The combined output of the five state-of-the-art named entity recognition tools (Multi-NER)\n",
    "3. Crowdsourcing experiments for correcting and improving the Multi-NER output and also for improving the expert-based gold standard (Multi-NER+Crowd). \n",
